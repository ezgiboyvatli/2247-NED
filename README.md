Aim of this study is to generate neuroendocrine bladder differentiated cell lines. One approach is to trigger trans differentiation with EGF treatment and analyze phenotypic and molecular effects of the differentiation. Firstly, T24 and 5637 cells, which are bladder cell line without neuroendocrine characteristics, were treated with EGF and after differentiation were generated how the morphology and molecular mechanism would have been affected was analyzed. The other approach is generating neuroendocrine differentiated cell lines by means of certain mutations. KRAS G12D, CTNNB1-S45F and ARID1A W2050* mutations will be generated by CRISPR/Cas9-HDR method or overexpressed mutated genes in SV-HUC-1 cell line.
