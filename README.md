# 2247-NED
The aims of this project are 
1) To determine β-catenin localization, mutation status and neuroendocrine properties of primary bladder cancer specimens
2- To model neuroendocrine differentiation by co-mutation of β-catenin and other tumor suppressor genes in normal bladder epithelial cell lines and to molecularly/phenotypically characterize the models to be created.
3- To examine the effect of small molecule drugs affecting the WNT/ β-catenin signaling pathway on cell models.
